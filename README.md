# Cyclone-Python
Hopefully make a cleaner version of Cyclone for filament winding and also work towards making it support 4+ axis winding

Warning: This software has yet to be tested in real life and is not advised to be run on a machine as it comes, I am not liable for any wasted filament or broken machines

This program is being designed to work more broadly than it's original, but is solely being tested on our custom machine
It can take the same input files as the original and should produce similar results once complete, so hopefully no need to update any successful winds you have created

So far what has been changed is the gcode for hoop layers has been made to work pretty similarly to the original but not be interpolated by the software, this way the machine can apply it's own interpolations. 

Work to be done:
Head rotations is still to be added on hoop
Helical needs to be completed
Physical testing
Usage guide needs to be done
Distrubition should be included

Please let me know if you notice any flaws or any errors when it comes to testing in Issues
